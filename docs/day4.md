# Day 4 – Real-Time Control Integration

### 🎯 Focus
Bringing real-time communication to life between nodes in **ROS 2**, enabling full robotic arm control.

### 🧠 Key Work
- Implemented two ROS 2 topics:
  - `/arm_command` → Receives motion commands.
  - `/arm_status` → Publishes live feedback of current arm state.
- Integrated **Pygame visualization** to render the 2-joint robotic arm in motion.
- Verified ROS 2 message passing and topic subscriptions.
- Established smooth, real-time movement and clean shutdown handling.
- Prepared the foundation for AI control by modularizing movement functions.

### ⚙️ Technical Progress
- ROS 2 message system working ✅  
- Visual feedback loop complete ✅  
- Ready for AI-driven commands ✅  

### 💪 Motivation
> “Control is not just about movement — it’s about awareness.  
> Once you can see what you control, you can teach it to learn.”
