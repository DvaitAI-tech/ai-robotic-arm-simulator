# Day 6 – AI Autopilot Integration

### 🎯 Focus
Evolving from manual control to **autonomous intelligence** — making the robotic arm think and act on its own.

### 🧠 Key Work
- Created a new ROS 2 node: `ai_autopilot.py`.  
- Implemented **autonomous decision logic** to generate random and pattern-based movement commands.  
- Enabled periodic publishing to `/arm_command` — allowing the arm to move automatically every few seconds.  
- Improved data logging (`arm_log.csv`) to record commands, angles, and timestamps.  
- Tested AI Autopilot in real-time — the robotic arm now executes decisions without human input.  
- Prepared the foundation for learning-based behavior (reinforcement or sequence prediction).

### ⚙️ Technical Progress
- AI Autopilot node functional ✅  
- ROS 2 integration tested ✅  
- Log data ready for ML model training ✅  
- System stable with continuous control loop ✅  

### 💪 Motivation
> “When logic begins to learn from experience,  
> control transforms into intelligence.”
