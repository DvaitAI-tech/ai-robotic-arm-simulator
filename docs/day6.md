# Day 6 – AI Autopilot + Control Dashboard

### 🎯 Focus
Building the **interface between mind and machine** — connecting the AI Robotic Arm with a real-time dashboard to visualize and control intelligence.

---

### 🧠 Key Work
- Created new ROS 2 node `ai_autopilot.py` for autonomous movement.
- Developed **Tkinter Dashboard UI** integrated with `/arm_command` and `/arm_status` topics.
- Added buttons for manual control (`Move Up`, `Move Down`, `Pick`, `Drop`, etc.).
- Live status updates now appear in the dashboard window in real time.
- Improved logging system for both AI and manual actions.
- Prepared for AI mode toggle and real-time telemetry view (Day 7 goal).

### ⚙️ Technical Progress
| Feature | Status |
|----------|---------|
| ROS 2 Autopilot Node | ✅ Completed |
| Tkinter GUI Dashboard | ✅ Completed |
| Real-time Feedback | ✅ Functional |
| Logging System | ✅ Updated |
| AI Mode Integration | 🔄 Planned (Day 7) |

### 💪 Motivation of the Day
> “When intelligence becomes visible, it becomes usable.  
> But when intelligence becomes emotional, it becomes unstoppable.”

### 🌱 Reflection
Day 6 was a turning point — DvaitAI evolved from code to experience.  
The dashboard gave life to intelligence, making it not just functional, but *felt*.

Tomorrow, we begin **Day 7**: where the arm learns from itself.

---

### 🧩 Next Steps
- Add **AI Mode Toggle** in Dashboard  
- Integrate **Learning Layer (RL or Pattern AI)**  
- Build **Telemetry Visualization (Angles vs Time)**

### ⚙️ DvaitAI Philosophy
> “True control is not pressing buttons — it’s designing a system that knows when not to move.”
